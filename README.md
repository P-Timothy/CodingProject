Project Title: South-East Lake Michigan Beach Erosion and Deposition

Name(s) of individual or team members
Team leader: P. Timothy Young Schragel
Not team leader 1: Shauny Jackson
Not team leader 2: Dalton Harris

Short 1-2 sentence summary
- Beaches (and/or dunes) along the south-eastern tip of Lake Michigan appear to have grown from 1985-2020, based on an early look from landsat images.
  We would like to find where and by how much the beaches and dunes have changed (based on region size), as well as potential causes why. 
  Additionally, we would like to locate potential clustering for the changes (or lack thereof).

Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s):
- Problem statement: How have beaches changed on the south-eastern tip of Lake Michigan from 1985-2020?
- questions/objectives:
	- If the beaches have changed, what are some of the potential causes?
		- Water level change
		- Weather patterns
			- storms
			- lake freezing
			- precipitation
		- current influences
		- human construction developments
		- plant growth (though this may be an effect and not a cause)
	- Where are clusters of change located?
		- perhaps along jetties or national parks

Datasets you will use (with links, if available)
- landsat (5 & 8):
- water levels: 

Python packages that team members require
- would we want the python version of GeoDa?
- should go through the core ones we have used within this class first
	- core Python packages from class

	- packages from class end

Planned methods/approach
- guess and check

Expected outcomes
- the beaches have changed (grown)
- these are potential causes
	- use correlation to compare the different causes
- where are clusters of change

Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.
